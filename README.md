This is a java project you can build with maven. To checkout how it works you can start the main function in the CT-Viewer. A Ui should show up in which you can select a CT-File to load and look at from different views. You can select the CtFileTest file (found in CtViewer/src/main/resources/CtFileTest ) to test it. There also a Logger and a Converter available. The Converter is able to convert a Ct-file (textual information of the patient + gray-scale values in the pattern 256 256 175) into a binary file with the gray scale values and a txt file with the patient info and a binary and txt file to a ct-file.
